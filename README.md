## Team Members

1. Chaoyu Yang chaoyu@uw.edu
2. Aniket Handa aniket@uw.edu

## Project Name

This is an example repository for assignment 3 submission. 
(a brief description of your final interactive visualization application and your dataset here.)


## Running Instructions

Put your running instructions here.  (Tell us how to open your visualization.) 

If your visualization is web-based,  it would be great if your submissions can be opened online. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is a good and easy way to put your visualization online so you can put your link here.  For example:

Access our visualization at http://cse512-14w.github.io/a3-chaoyu-aniket/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.


## Story Board

Put either your storyboard content or a [link to your storyboard pdf file](storyboard.pdf?raw=true) here.   Just like A2, you can use any software to create a *reasonable* pdf storyboard.


### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation

A paragraph explaining changes between the storyboard and the final implementation.


## Development Process

Include:
- Breakdown of how the work was split among the group members. 
- a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: 
  - Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application?
  - What aspects took the most time?
